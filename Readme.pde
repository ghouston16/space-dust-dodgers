Brief description of the game developed:
The game developed is called Spacedust Dodgers which is a one player game based on the classic game Space Race  which given time could be modified for two players. 
The objective of the game is to move the paddle from the bottom of the display to the top without being hit by debris to accumulaate points. 


Justification of spec: Contained in reflection

Known bugs/problems: The paddle does not operate until display is clicked.
